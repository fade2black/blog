# Welcome to my Perosnal Blog

This blog is a space where I share my journey with the Rust programming language. Here, you’ll find my thoughts, experiments, and results as I explore Rust, cryptography, distributed systems, and cloud computing world. I’ll also share useful code snippets and tips that I’ve learned along the way.

## [Secure Communication with Kyber and Dilithium in Rust](kyber-dilithium.md)

[<div class="abstract">
What Is Post-Quantum Cryptography? Quantum computers are no longer just science fiction—they’re getting real. And with them comes a big challenge: they could break many of the cryptographic systems we rely on today to keep our data safe. Most current encryption methods, like RSA or Elliptic Curve Cryptography,...

## [Implementing Distributed Cron Jobs with etcd](kyber-dilithium.md)

[<div class="abstract">
In this article I’ll walk you through a project I built using Rust that acts as a distributed cron scheduler. This project allows users to add, list, and remove cron jobs via a set of RESTful endpoints. The system continuously monitors the current time, ensuring that scheduled tasks ...

## [Building Leader Election in Distributed Systems with etcd](leader-election.md)

[<div class="abstract">
In distributed systems, leader election is a critical process that ensures coordination and consistency across multiple nodes. One way to implement leader election is through the use of a reliable key-value store, such as etcd. In this article, I'll explore how to implement a simple leader election implementation in Rust using an etcd server. ...
